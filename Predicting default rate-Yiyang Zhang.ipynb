    ">In the <b>Business Understanding</b> part, we analyze our primary goal and identify the question. \n",
    "\n",
    ">In the <b>Data Understanding and Quality Check</b> part, we propose the four dimensions of data quality check and use those dimensions as our baseline of the data quality check. Then we inspect the data as a whole to skim through our dataset. Next, we focused on checking the data quality in terms of Uniqueness, Completeness, Validity, and Accuracy. Lastly, we come up with data quality insights.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the <b>Data Munging</b> part, we fix the data quality issues and engineered features according to domain knowledge and business understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the <b>Machine Learning Modelling</b> part, we use several feature engineering techniques. The first technique is to find features with a high percentage of missing values(80% and up). The second technique uses correlation analysis to find the colinear features- with a threshold above 0.8. The third technique is to find the Features with zero standard deviation (contains the same value, only 'CHANNEL1_6M'). The fourth technique is to find Features with high ranking in Step Forward Selection. Then we build the XGBoost algorithm for baseline and tune the hyperparameters using Grid Search. Considering it's an imbalanced dataset, after we get the hyperparameters of XGBoost, we use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE) in our XGBoost model to oversample the examples in the minority class to get better performance. The SMOTE-XGBoost model is our final algorithm and gets an AUC-ROC score of 85% in 10-fold cross-validation. Then we calculate some statistics and visualize the data. \n",
    "\n",
    ">My analysis successfully prepares the data for modeling and creates an excellent SMOTE-XGBoost model with a good performance in terms of the AUC score. We can use our model to predict the likelihood that each policyholder will make a service payment call and address the business problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the <b>What's Next- the future improvement</b> part, we reflect on what's the potential improvement for our analysis."

    ">A problem with imbalanced classification is that there are too few examples of the minority class for a model to effectively learn the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One way to solve this problem is to oversample the examples in the minority class. This can be achieved by simply duplicating examples from the minority class in the training dataset prior to fitting a model. This can balance the class distribution but does not provide any additional information to the model.An improvement on duplicating examples from the minority class is to synthesize new examples from the minority class. This is a type of data augmentation for tabular data and can be very effective.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is the perfect solution here.SMOTE works by selecting examples that are close in the feature space, drawing a line between the examples in the feature space and drawing a new sample at a point along that line. SMOTE first selects a minority class instance a at random and finds its k nearest minority class neighbors. The synthetic instance is then created by choosing one of the k nearest neighbors b at random and connecting a and b to form a line segment in the feature space. The synthetic instances are generated as a convex combination of the two chosen instances a and b."
